  **MOVED TO `/curriculum/FAQ/index.md`**

  Q: Sorry, I forgot to ask what platform we'll be using for class in case I need to download something?

  A: Our main tools are the browser (through which you'll be accessing the curriculum -https://in-tech-gration.github.io/WDX-180/- and study material), our code editor (VSCode) and a few other tools (Node, git, etc.)

  Q: I think I was confused. I meant are you using something like Webex or Google for when lectures are live? Or do we not have live lectures. I forgot to ask earlier today.

  A: We use Google Meet.

## Week 01 - Day 02

  Q: Why did we use git add . instead of git add user/week01/progress/progress.w01.d01.csv?

  A: By using "git add ." you tell Git to add for commit any changes you've made to files inside your current working directory. If the only file you've changed is "user/week01/progress/progress.w01.d01.csv" the two commands that you mention do the exact same thing. When you are sure that you want to add to your next commit any file changed in your current working directory, doing "git add ." is much faster than adding each file changed one by one. Do not forget to check the status of your repo (git status) after every command, just to make sure that there is nothing wrong going on! :)

  Q: Could someone provide me an advice please?:) I don't receive notifications from the slack, I need from time to time to open the app in order to check if some information arrives. But obviously it's not convenient..
