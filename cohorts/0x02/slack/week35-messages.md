- Good morning everyone! If you are up to the following challenges, the CMS repo is open to Pull Requests. :slightly_smiling_face:
 - Create a function that returns the HTML content based on the pathname and some dynamic values
 - Create an abstraction over the server router: pathname => load data => render HTML
- Good morning,i have no idea what you are talking about 
- Yesterday, we returned some HTML from the web server (web.ts). This was just a simple template String literal. We can abstract this in a  function for better re-usability. The web server checks the pathname using a basic if conditional and returns a custom HTML. By adding more paths, this code will become  complicated and bloated. Maybe you can think of an abstraction so that the request pathname => appropriate HTML works better than the current implementation.
- Take a look at the CMS current code and think of how it can be improved with various abstractions (think functions) for scaling and extending.
- In general, try to improve the current code so that we can move forward.
