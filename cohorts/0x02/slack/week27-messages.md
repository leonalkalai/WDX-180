- Good morning everyone! Today you should spend some time on :wheelchair: accessibility, because Drag-n-Drop can become a problem,
not a feature when A11y is not properly taken care of. Here are some recommended articles to read and some code to study and explore:

- Good morning everyone! Two suggestions for this weekend:
  - Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Cbkoo4Gwg){:target="_blank"} which provides some useful for using 2-dimensional tables (think cell grids) 
  - Finalize your React Quiz code and push the latest changes to the repo's branches so we can review what has been done so far and move forward
  - Enjoy the weekend as much as you can! :sunny:
