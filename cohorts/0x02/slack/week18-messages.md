- Your task for this week is to try and replicate all the features of the [Countries Quiz game](https://www.jetpunk.com/quizzes/how-many-countries-can-you-name){:target="_blank"}. Even though this is a personal project, we expect you to schedule at least 2 calls during the week to discuss, share and solve several challenges together with your classmates. Features include:
  - Star quiz button
  - Timer
  - List of Continents and countries found (and not found)
  - Pause timer button
  - Disable timer button
  - Help box
  - Give up button
  - Guesses counter
  - Advanced: show missing countries (this one is certainly requires a group call)
  - more...
  - Your extra features!? :sunglasses:

- If anyone gets an error of CORS cross origin request blocked when you are using an external link URL for files as Fonts, images,icons etc a way to fix it is to host the files to GitHub and create GitHub pages for the repository. After use the URL of the GitHub pages for each file.
  - Which files exactly are producing the CORS errors on your side ?
  - Custom fonts. I tried using Dropbox, GitHub to host the files and even at local HTML i got CORS when i set the links from the web
  - Hmmm. Strange. I would not expect a CORS issue locally, since we're talking about the same domain (Origin).
  - The index.html is in local drive but the files are on the web. So they are not same origin.
  - Oh, I see.
