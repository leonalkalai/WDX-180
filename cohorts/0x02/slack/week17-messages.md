- Here's today's [challenge](https://in-tech-gration.github.io/WDX-180/curriculum/modules/javascript/misc/tweeter_practice/){:target="_blank"}

- Good evening! I have finished some work about what we have learned and the [exercise](https://codepen.io/leonalkalai/pen/ZEPRgBd){:target="_blank"} from abed but i need also help from anyone about my errors in console.
  - Great work on the exercise Leon!I think it's safe to say that both of the console errors that you mention, are not your fault.:+1:
  - Do you have the Selected Context (settings) checked?
  - No why? I don't even know what is that.
  - It disabled some of the console output that you see, that comes from browser extensions or scripts external to the app that you are testing. Try it out at some point and see if irrelevant console messages disappear (e.g. codepen related, extension, etc.)
  - nice one you got 10 coins for this :arrow_down: only :money_mouth_face:
  - Yes but i want to know how to solve this errors, not disable them.

- This is my [solution](https://codepen.io/leonalkalai/pen/mdojrax) for the exercise about the toggle on 3 different values.
  - Amazing work on both codepens!
  - You can also use user-select: none; on the .cell to avoid the distracting accidental text/icon select.
  - The only problem I see, is that the counter is a global variable, which makes the first click work ok on a single cell, but displays the wrong icon on another cell.
  - e.g. Checkmark on the first click on the firs cell, the ? on the 2nd click on the 2nd cell, when it should have been a Checkmark also.
  - Don't worry though, as Thursday is dedicated to replicating the Murdle puzzle grid. :slightly_smiling_face:
  - Stay tuned...
  - Once again, great work! :100:

- Here's the [mystery](https://in-tech-gration.github.io/WDX-180/curriculum/modules/javascript/misc/murdle_table/){:target="_blank"} you have to solve today
  - good morning lol, not an easy challenge :stuck_out_tongue:
  - Yep, certainly not an easy one, but if you break the problem down to the tiniest task, e.g. make a single grid cell work as expected, it's going to be easier to re-use the solution for the rest of the grid cells.
  - lol this is a group project lol, i think you made that on purpose so that everyone asks for help lol
  - the images/icons on [Murdle](https://murdle.com/){:target="_blank"} are not the same as the screenshots.
  - Yes, you are right. Murdle has a new mystery every day. Just use the ones available today.
  - I think we should take this as a group project. This is huge. A lot of things to do really.
  - I believe, if you focus on a single grid cell, and make it toggle from check to X to ? and then back to empty cell, you are half-way through solving the app. Then, it's all about re-using this single cell across the board. And, lastly, clicking the side icons and showing a simple modal. Just go through it, see what you can do today and learn along the way. don't worry about completing all the tasks on a single day.
  - I can do it all but not in one day.
  - That's fine. Just focus on what you can do today, and you'll have a homework challenge for the rest of the course. :laughing:
  - but i would love to hear from others from the team also...
  - If you want to listen from me ,then 'how i can download images/icons?"
  - `Leon.addEventListener("question", e => if ( e.target === "Mary" ) answer() )`
  - `Leon.removeEventListener("question", answer() ) anyone.addEventListener("question",(e)=>{ alert("reader should answer") } )`
  - i took screenshots
  - `const kostas_the_teacher= document.querySelector("@kostasx"); kostas_the_teacher.style.display= "none; kostas_the_teacher.style.display.remove();`
  - How about just selecting the icons and hitting Ctrl+C? ...then Ctrl+V
  - :female-cook::curly_haired_man: SUSPECTS :baby::restroom::gift::shinto_shrine: LOCATIONS :tulip:
  - Noooooooooo :joy::joy::joy:
