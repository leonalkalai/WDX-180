- Good morning everyone! Some suggestions for continuing on the Battleship game development
  - Think about the challenges we face (position ships, drag-and-drop, confine ships to specific positions, not allowing ships to overflow, etc.) and come up with some ideas or algorithms to solve these problems
  - It would be nice to have some diagrams and some pseudo code that will explain the logic behind each solution
  - Ideally, we will discuss them tomorrow and integrate them into our source code using those diagrams, pseudo code and other helpful planning
  - Check the [original source code](https://replit.com/@kostasx/Battleship-29042024#battleship.js){:target="_blank"} to remember how we've built the basic setup and think of ways to improve it
  - It's a great idea to study some game videos that are based on the Canvas API to get some ideas and "steal" some of the good practices (e.g. using prototype, etc.)
