# Functional Programming in Javascript Part 01

_(Updated: 07/02/2024)_

Up until this point, you have gotten your hands dirty with JavaScript and maybe you have heard about the term **Functional Programming** thought your short journey. That's expected, since JavaScript is, at its core, a high-level functional programming language. But what do we mean exactly with the term functional programming?

## What is Functional Programming?

In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.

In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning that they can be bound to names (including local identifiers), passed as arguments, and returned from other functions, just as any other data type can. This allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner.

We're getting too technical about it, and it's not everyone's cup of tea, but there is no need to worry! We've got you covered as always! However, if you still want to explore the concept of functional programming though a more academic lens, you can always read the [dedicated wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming){:target="_blank"}!

## Microsoft's Reactive Extensions (Rx) Library for Javascript

In this section, we're going to start diving deeper to the concept of functional programming by following this interactive tutorial on **Microsoft's Reactive Extensions (Rx) Library for Javascript**!

This specific tutorial consists of 41 exercises, along with enough theoretical content, in order to getting used to working with tools to abstract common collection operations into reusable, composable building blocks. You'll be surprised to learn that most of the operations you perform on collections can be accomplished with five simple functions (some native to JavaScript and some included in the RxJS library)

For the first part, we want you to **complete the Exercises 1 to 14**, where 3 functions (_map_, _filter_, _concatAll_) are extensively covered.

Don't wast any more time and [**click here**](https://reactivex.io/learnrx/) to start experimenting!

> Notes: We highly suggest that you take your time and complete each exercise before moving on to the next one. As you can see, if exercise X is not solved, exercise X+1 is hidden. Of course, the tutorial provides the solutions to all exercises, with a click of a button. Please make the use of it only if you are feeling completely stuck!
