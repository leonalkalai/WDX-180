# Code Reading Sessions

This folder contains a set of exercises which can be used in Code Reading Clubs.
Of course, your club does not need to use all exercises, they are meant as a
starting point. If you are trying out variants, do let us know! For now we have
divided them into [basic](./basic.md?--defaults) and [advanced](./advanced.md?--defaults). [Advanced exercises](./advanced.md?--defaults) can be used in clubs
that have been running for a while, and especially work well when doing a second
code club using the same code snippet.
